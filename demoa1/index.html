            <div class="title">How Getty turns interaction into connection</div>
            <div class="context">Getty created Sculpting Harmony by blending architech, storytelling and technology with
                the aims to bring the creative journey of Frank Gehry and his team - who designed the Walt Disney
                Concert Hall - to the audience.

                Opening the website, my eyes were immediately drawn to the orange background, the sketch
                and title's animation. The main objective of the website wasn't clearly indicated at the start but
                the
                combination of the animated sketch, the bright background color and the eye-catching title implied
                that
                this website was developed with lots of effort and thoughtfulness from the creators, with which I
                can
                expect this to be a pleasant experience to enjoy. Indeed, after understanding about its theme, this
                design choice has successfully enhanced the artistic values of the project, when the creative
                process of
                classical art was expressed through a digital concept.
            </div>
            <div class="answ5">
                Sculpting Harmony is designed to/The experience or Getty aims to show/archive the creative
                process of how Frank Gehry designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall, by means of which to honor
                architect
                as a form of art and bring these artistic values closer to the public. Through the story, the
                website
                reveals the connection between architect, music, culture with the audience. Rather than regular
                presentation of information, Getty provides users the ability to explore as if they were physically
                presenting at the building. By using different types of materials with a visually stunning design
                and
                animation, Getty suggests that the website is not only designed to educate but also to evoke the
                sense
                of creativity, which is also what Frank Gehry wanted to convey through his work.
            </div>
            <div class="answ2">
                After landing on the homepage, I followed the guide on the mouse cursor and enabled sound by
                clicking.
                My attention was drawn to the compelling homepage so I hovered the mouse cursor everywhere and
                explored
                all the animation in the homepage. Then I started scrolling down for further exploration. At the
                introduction part, I kept scrolling back and forth because I was fond of the parallax animation.
                Afterward, I scrolled down to go into chapter 1. My curiosity made me click onto the “EXPLORE THE
                MODEL”
                button for further information after finishing the video. Subsequently, I kept scrolling for next
                chapter, reading information, watching videos with subtitle, enjoying the animation. The process
                repeated a few times before I finished the experience at the website's footer.
            </div>
            <div class="answ3">
                “Chapter 1: Ship in the Box” was the part that took most of my time during the experience. The
                transition from the image in the parallax animation to the chapter's title is very impressive. Since
                it's the opening of the story, chapter 1 showed Frank's initial insight and approach towards Walt
                Disney
                Concert Hall. The interactive storytelling communicated clearly Frank's ideation about how he could
                enhance the connection between people and music in the design. In terms of users' experience, the
                inclusion of video, sketches, models and especially music prompted the feeling of being at a
                physical
                exhibition where they can sense Frank's appreciation for art and people. Furthermore, there were
                subtitles placed in the perfect position out of the whole layout when watching videos, making the
                chapter more engaging toward users whose first language is not English.
            </div>
            <div class="answ4">
                Throughout the 2-minute of interacting with the experience, my most regular action was scrolling,
                which
                is the main pattern of behavior for this website, randomly interrupted by some clicks to extend the
                content. I found scrolling in this website highly satisfying because of the integrated animation and
                transition from part to part. For example, in the Introduction the parallax-style animated footage,
                which created a illusion of spatial depth, got me scrolling back and forth to see the transition
                more
                clearly. Getty has skillfully turned a simple flow of action, together with the chapter-based
                structure,
                into a captivating behavior, which intensified users' immersive experience.
            </div>
            <div class="answ13">
                The seamless combination of visual design, parallax animation and the systematic structure of the
                narrative is what I enjoy the most about this experience. Personally, I always pay attention to the
                motion and transition the most when having interactive experience. Up to my expectation when I first
                landed on Getty's website, the parallax animation elicits an illusion of spatial depth for the whole
                “online space” - especially in the Introduction prologue and when transitioning among chapters -
                making
                the basic scrolling behavior more satisfying. The visually aesthetic design perfectly matches the
                atmosphere of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. These two factors in combination with a story layered in
                particular details have produced a consistent feeling of connection that can reach a wide range of
                audience. Notably, this consonance is also what Frank Gehry and his team wanted to convey when they
                started the project.
            </div>
            <div class="answ6">
                Getty's website has successfully communicated the primary message through a thoroughly arranged
                combination of design, storytelling and interactive experience. The website makes it easier for
                users to
                expose to information while still keep its educational quality thanks to a variation of materials in
                different forms. The Introduction part is an excellent opening for the whole story with its design,
                animation and spatial illusion, which provoke intriguing emotion from users. Each chapters are well
                built in solid structure of text so that users can follow in a relaxing way. The chapter to chapter
                organization also covers the creative process in every respect. Music is the perfect element to
                provoke
                users' feeling and set an artistic tone for the whole experience especially right from the
                beginning.
                Getty has efficiently created a connection between Frank Gehry's work and the viewers' feeling,
                reinforcing the work's aesthetic and artistic values.
            </div>
            <div class="answ7">
                For me, Getty's website is designed to be explored in one sitting but also invite viewers to
                comeback
                for a deeper dive. On the first visit the content is displayed enough for a short focused session.
                At
                the same time, there are small buttons such as “EXPLORE THE MODEL” or “READ MORE” which are a subtle
                indication for a exploration into the beneath layers. The clearly straightforward structure of
                chapter
                to chapter enable users to jump to a specific part or save it for their next visit. The parallax
                animation and transition make it look like the story is revealing each of its layers seamlessly,
                making
                the interaction playful and worth exploring rather than just reading a set of information.
                Scrolling,
                which is the main interactive behavior, encourages a continuous flow of action from users but also
                requires attention to details. This behavior doesn't just drive viewers forward but also stimulate
                the
                sense of engagement, proposing a revisit for a deeper and slower dive into the archive and the story
                underneath. With this design, the experience can be optimized for multiple purposes such as casual
                visit, education or architect/art enthusiast.
            </div>
            <div class="answ9">
                Getty included a wide range of materials such as photographs, video, music, models and hand sketch.
                This
                inclusion of diverse materials' forms relates to the approach of a documentary film or a physical
                exhibition in a museum, where users are presented to materials in various forms and they can explore
                freely, enhancing the emotional value of the story. The graphic design look and titles' typography
                also
                recall to a colorful printed art book. Meanwhile, the animation creates a impression of spatial
                depth,
                which bears a resemblance to the cinematic shots in movies. All of these methods show the
                significant
                interest and appreciation to the project from the creators themselves.
            </div>
            <div class="answ12">
                However, I found some frustrations in my first time experiencing. It was the limited control over
                the
                videos. When watching video, users can jump to a specific time part, pause or even skip the whole
                video.
                However, they can't go a few seconds forward or backward. For example, if I accidently miss a
                footage or
                just simply want to go 2 seconds backward to carefully look into some small details, I have to jump
                to
                the previous time stamp and watch the whole previous part, which is a bit time-consuming and
                inconvenient. Furthermore, the transparent navigation bar may be not immediately noticeable. This
                small
                issue might make it harder for first-time experience if the reader want to jump to a specific part,
                which is what I encountered in my first visit.
            </div>
            <div class="answ8">
                Getty's website still communicates its encouragement for repeated engagement to users through its
                design
                without any obvious mechanism or features. The chapter-based structure goes with a story with
                multiple
                layers, suggesting that viewers can freely explore as how they want to. There are button such as
                “READ
                MORE” or “EXPLORE THE MODEL” which also communicates subtle signals about a revisit for deeper
                discovery. The vertical format and scrolling behavior are designed for gaining enough information in
                one
                sitting, which in addition with the story's layers beneath intrigues curiosity and implies an
                invitation
                for future revisit. The insertion of music and archival materials also prompts a sense of physical
                presence in a museum. Through all of these organization, the website indirectly suggests that it's a
                open resource encouraging future returns if users want to explore more deeply.
            </div>
            <div class="answ11">
                The experience has set a formal atmosphere right from the beginning when classical music is enabled.
                Afterward, the archival items and story layers are designed to prompt a mood of emotion, curiosity
                and
                admiration when going further into the exploration, which is similar to how users feel when visiting
                a
                museum. With that, Getty successfully encourages a sense of appreciation and gives users a more
                interesting and purposeful interaction rather than just purely educational experience.
            </div>
            <div class="answ10">
                This approach of Getty suggest a slow and attentive experience, which is similar to approaching a
                documentary film or visiting a museum. Users are encourage to be observant of details rather than
                immediately rushing to the end. Furthermore, the use of classical music evoke a relaxing atmosphere,
                helping viewers to make connection with the materials and enjoy to the fullest. Generally, the
                experience indicate a highly cinematic quality and that it's designed to be savored.

                For me, Getty's website is designed to be explored in one sitting but also invite viewers to comeback
                for a deeper dive. On the first visit the content is displayed enough for a short focused session. At
                the same time, there are small buttons such as “EXPLORE THE MODEL” or “READ MORE” which are a subtle
                indication for a exploration into the beneath layers. The clearly straightforward structure of chapter
                to chapter enable users to jump to a specific part or save it for their next visit. The parallax
                animation and transition make it look like the story is revealing each of its layers seamlessly, making
                the interaction playful and worth exploring rather than just reading a set of information. Scrolling,
                which is the main interactive behavior, encourages a continuous flow of action from users but also
                requires attention to details. This behavior doesn't just drive viewers forward but also stimulate the
                sense of engagement, proposing a revisit for a deeper and slower dive into the archive and the story
                underneath. With this design, the experience can be optimized for multiple purposes such as casual
                visit, education or architect/art enthusiast.</p>

                Getty included a wide range of materials such as photographs, video, music, models and hand sketch. This
                inclusion of diverse materials' forms relates to the approach of a documentary film or a physical
                exhibition in a museum, where users are presented to materials in various forms and they can explore
                freely, enhancing the emotional value of the story. The graphic design look and titles' typography also
                recall to a colorful printed art book. Meanwhile, the animation creates a impression of spatial depth,
                which bears a resemblance to the cinematic shots in movies. All of these methods show the significant
                interest and appreciation to the project from the creators themselves.</p>

                However, I found some frustrations in my first time experiencing. It was the limited control over the
                videos. When watching video, users can jump to a specific time part, pause or even skip the whole video.
                However, they can't go a few seconds forward or backward. For example, if I accidently miss a footage or
                just simply want to go 2 seconds backward to carefully look into some small details, I have to jump to
                the previous time stamp and watch the whole previous part, which is a bit time-consuming and
                inconvenient. Furthermore, the transparent navigation bar may be not immediately noticeable. This small
                issue might make it harder for first-time experience if the reader want to jump to a specific part,
                which is what I encountered in my first visit.</p>

                Getty's website still communicates its encouragement for repeated engagement to users through its design
                without any obvious mechanism or features. The chapter-based structure goes with a story with multiple
                layers, suggesting that viewers can freely explore as how they want to. There are button such as “READ
                MORE” or “EXPLORE THE MODEL” which also communicates subtle signals about a revisit for deeper
                discovery. The vertical format and scrolling behavior are designed for gaining enough information in one
                sitting, which in addition with the story's layers beneath intrigues curiosity and implies an invitation
                for future revisit. The insertion of music and archival materials also prompts a sense of physical
                presence in a museum. Through all of these organization, the website indirectly suggests that it's a
                open resource encouraging future returns if users want to explore more deeply.</p>

                The experience has set a formal atmosphere right from the beginning when classical music is enabled.
                Afterward, the archival items and story layers are designed to prompt a mood of emotion, curiosity and
                admiration when going further into the exploration, which is similar to how users feel when visiting a
                museum. With that, Getty successfully encourages a sense of appreciation and gives users a more
                interesting and purposeful interaction rather than just purely educational experience.</p>
            <p id="answ10">
                This approach of Getty suggest a slow and attentive experience, which is similar to approaching a
                documentary film or visiting a museum. Users are encourage to be observant of details rather than
                immediately rushing to the end. Furthermore, the use of classical music evoke a relaxing atmosphere,
                helping viewers to make connection with the materials and enjoy to the fullest. Generally, the
                experience indicate a highly cinematic quality and that it's designed to be savored</p> -->

                    <p> also known as Louis Daguerre who was a French scientist, artist and photographer recognized for
                        his invention of the eponymous
                        daguerreotype process of photography. He became known as one of the fathers of photography.
                        Though he is most famous for his contributions to photography, he was also an accomplished
                        painter, scenic designer, and a developer of the diorama theatre.</p>

                    <p>In 1838 Daguerre took this photo of the Boulevard du Temple, better known at the time as “Crime
                        Boulevard” because of the murders played every night in the dozens of theaters of the boulevard.
                        This is the oldest known photograph of a human being. In a place full of Parisians, this picture
                        does not fix because of the 10 minutes exposure time…

                    <p>The whole scene was empty because all the surrounding movement was too fast to be captured during
                        the 10
                        minutes of exposing. Despite all that, a recognizable human form remained motionless enough to
                        be immortalized. One can indeed notice at the left of the pic a man polishing his shoes. The
                        shoe-shine boy also appears, although he is blurred.</p>

                        evolutionary photography method called Daguerretype.
                        He debuted his invention to the French Academy of Sciences and the Académie des Beaux-Arts in
                        1839, where it was received as a nearly miraculous discovery. Word of the invention spread and
                        today, Daguerre is credited as being one of the fathers of photography. He is also one of the 72
                        people whose name is inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.
